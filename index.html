        At the Manchester Animal Shelter, we believe all animals are deserving of life, respect and care. Our goal is zero-population-growth through spay/neuter programs and services that focus on education, medical care, fostering and adoption. Friends of Manchester Animal Shelter is a non-profit organization which started in 1996. The shelter takes in homeless, abused, and abandoned animals in the city of Manchester. We provide shelter, medical care, and spay/neuter to every animal that comes through our doors. In operation for nearly two decades, the shelter has helped provide care and find loving homes for over 20,000 animals.

        <p>Hi, my name is Vicky and I am a 1 year old female domestic Lurcher.

          I am a very active, playful girl who loves to get out and about and investigate new surroundings.

          I am very clever so really love to be given plenty of activities to keep my growing brain busy.

          I am an affectionate girl, who loves to spend time with you having fuss and attention, so I would really like to only be left alone for a short time in my home.

          I would like to live with a family with sensible, teenagers who will be able to cope with my exuberant nature and would really like it if we can meet at the centre so that we can make friends.</p>

        <p>
          My name is Bella.

          I have always lived with my mother Tinkerbell, I can be thought of as a little shy but my curiosity is growing. I am more confident when my mother is around so would need to be rehomed with her. I do still get nervous around loud sudden noises so a quiet home would suit me well. I would love for my new family to bring me out of my shell with lots of love and care. If you are interested in me please submit a homefinder. I am currently staying at Hadlow College in London.

        <p>
          The largest living tortoise, Galapagos tortoises are endemic to the Galapagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador in South America. These reptiles are herbivores, and feed on grasses, leaves, vines and fruit. With an estimated average life-span of 150 to 200 years, only about 15,000 remain due to hunting for food during the 18th and 19th centuries. Hunting of the tortoise is now prohibited, but its eggs are threatened by introduced species such as rats and cats.

        <p>We are happy that you have decided to adopt a Gecko. Gecko adoption is a wonderful way to provide a Gecko a second chance and caring environment. Most pets arrive at shelters because the owner had to move, could no longer afford the pet, had a death in the family, or simply gave up the responsibly of being a care taker for a Gecko. Before bringing home a Gecko, make sure you have considered the full impact of your decision. Below is a brief overview of the type of needs a Gecko might require and what you will need to consider for the life time care of a Gecko.</p>

        The ARL carries out this mission through our three shelters in Boston, Brewster, and Dedham, and our law enforcement, rescue, and veterinary services. In 2015, over 13,300 animals received care and assistance through all ARL programs and services.

        The ARL received no government or public funding to carry on this important work.  We rely solely on the generosity of individuals like you to help animals in need.

        Thank you for your interest and support!
